HashSet: Fast, unordered set using hashing.

LinkedHashSet: Like HashSet but maintains insertion order.

TreeSet: Sorted set (natural or custom order), slower than HashSet.

EnumSet: High-performance set for enum types only.

CopyOnWriteArraySet: Thread-safe set, best for many reads and few writes.

ConcurrentSkipListSet: Thread-safe, sorted set for concurrent access
