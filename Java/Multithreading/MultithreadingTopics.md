## âœ… Java Multithreading â€“ Full Topic List (Basics to Advanced)

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **1. Introduction to Multithreading**

* What is a thread?
* Process vs Thread
* Advantages of multithreading
* When and why to use threads
* Life cycle of a thread
* Thread states (NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, etc.)

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **2. Creating Threads**

* Extending `Thread` class
* Implementing `Runnable` interface
* Creating threads using lambda
* Using `start()` vs `run()`

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **3. Thread Methods**

* `sleep()`
* `join()`
* `yield()`
* `setPriority()`, `getPriority()`
* `isAlive()`, `currentThread()`

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **4. Thread Scheduling & Life Cycle**

* Time-slicing and context switching
* Daemon threads vs user threads
* Thread priority and fairness
* Preemptive vs cooperative multitasking
* Thread lifecycle methods

---

### ðŸŸ  **5. Synchronization & Thread Safety**

* Race conditions and data inconsistency
* Synchronized methods and blocks
* Intrinsic locks (object monitor)
* Reentrant locks
* Lock class (`java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`)
* Volatile keyword
* Atomic variables (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, etc.)

---

### ðŸŸ  **6. Inter-Thread Communication**

* `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`
* Producer-consumer problem
* Low-level object monitor methods
* Spurious wakeups and best practices

---

### ðŸ”µ **7. Thread Groups and ThreadLocal**

* Thread groups: purpose and usage
* `ThreadLocal` variables (per-thread storage)
* Use cases in web applications or logging

---

### ðŸ”µ **8. Executor Framework (High-Level API)**

* `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`
* Thread pools (`FixedThreadPool`, `CachedThreadPool`, etc.)
* `submit()` vs `execute()`
* `Callable` and `Future`
* `invokeAll()`, `invokeAny()`

---

### ðŸ”µ **9. ThreadPoolExecutor (Advanced Control)**

* Core vs max threads
* Keep-alive time
* Task queue types
* RejectedExecutionHandler
* Custom thread factory
* Monitoring pool state

---

### ðŸ”µ **10. Scheduled Thread Pools**

* Delayed and recurring tasks
* `scheduleAtFixedRate()` vs `scheduleWithFixedDelay()`

---

### ðŸ”´ **11. Fork/Join Framework**

* What is divide and conquer
* `ForkJoinPool` and `RecursiveTask`
* Use cases like parallel sorting, searching
* Comparison with thread pools

---

### ðŸ”´ **12. Concurrency Utilities**

* `CountDownLatch`
* `CyclicBarrier`
* `Semaphore`
* `Exchanger`
* `Phaser`

---

### ðŸ”´ **13. Concurrent Collections**

* `ConcurrentHashMap`
* `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
* `BlockingQueue` (`ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`)
* `PriorityBlockingQueue`
* `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, `ConcurrentSkipListMap`

---

### ðŸ”´ **14. Advanced Topics**

* Deadlocks (causes, detection, prevention)
* Livelocks
* Starvation and fairness
* Thread dumps and analysis
* Performance tuning and profiling

---

### ðŸ§  **15. Real-World Use Cases**

* Web server thread pools
* Background job processors
* Event-driven systems
* Asynchronous REST calls
* Logging frameworks
* Android UI threading (Handler, Looper)

---

### ðŸ§  **16. Interview Questions & Coding Challenges**

* Deadlock detection code
* Producer-consumer implementation
* Custom thread pool executor
* Rate limiter using semaphore
* Ordered execution of threads

---

## ðŸ“Œ Bonus: Java 8+ Enhancements
