The **Java Concurrency API** (found in the `java.util.concurrent` package) provides high-level **thread-safe tools**, **utilities**, and **data structures** to build **scalable and robust multithreaded applications**. It was introduced in Java 5 to solve problems like race conditions, thread coordination, and resource locking in a clean and reliable way.

---

## ðŸ§µ Why Java Concurrency API?

Before this API, developers had to use low-level primitives like:

* `synchronized`, `wait()`, `notify()`
* `Thread.sleep()`, `join()`, etc.

But these were error-prone and hard to scale. The concurrency API offers ready-made tools to manage:

âœ… **Thread pools**
âœ… **Atomic variables**
âœ… **Locks**
âœ… **Queues**
âœ… **Barriers and Latches**
âœ… **Executors and scheduling**
âœ… **Thread-safe collections**

## ðŸ”§ Java Concurrency API â€“ Organized by Utility

---

### 1. **Executor Framework** (Replaces `new Thread()`)

| Class/Interface               | Use                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Executor`, `ExecutorService` | Submit and manage tasks                |
| `Executors`                   | Factory class to create thread pools   |
| `ScheduledExecutorService`    | Run tasks with delays or periodically  |
| `Callable`                    | Return values from threads             |
| `Future`                      | Hold result of a task (like a promise) |

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
pool.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello"));
pool.shutdown();
```

---

### 2. **Locks & Synchronization Tools**

| Class                  | Use                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ReentrantLock`        | Advanced locking with fairness, interruptibility |
| `ReadWriteLock`        | Read and write locks for shared resources        |
| `StampedLock` (Java 8) | More performant read/write locking               |

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
   // critical section
} finally {
   lock.unlock();
}
```

---

### 3. **Thread Coordination Utilities**

| Class            | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CountDownLatch` | Wait for other threads to finish before continuing      |
| `CyclicBarrier`  | Let threads wait until all reach a common barrier point |
| `Semaphore`      | Limit access to a resource (like max 3 users)           |
| `Exchanger`      | Let two threads exchange data                           |

---

### 4. **Concurrent Collections**

These are **thread-safe** collections that allow high concurrency.

| Collection                                                          | Use                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ConcurrentHashMap`                                                 | Thread-safe `HashMap`                            |
| `CopyOnWriteArrayList`                                              | Safe array list where reads are more than writes |
| `BlockingQueue` (e.g., `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`) | Used in Producer-Consumer problems               |
| `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`                                             | Non-blocking queue                               |

---

### 5. **Atomic Variables (No `synchronized` needed)**

Atomic classes use **compare-and-swap (CAS)** for **lock-free** thread safety.

| Class                                          | Use                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicBoolean` | Atomic operations on primitives |
| `AtomicReference`, `AtomicStampedReference`    | For object references           |

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet(); // atomic
```

---

### 6. **Fork/Join Framework**

Used to **recursively split tasks** into smaller subtasks (introduced in Java 7).

| Component          | Use                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `ForkJoinPool`     | Manages worker threads |
| `RecursiveTask<V>` | Returns result         |
| `RecursiveAction`  | Void result            |

---

### 7. **CompletableFuture (Java 8+)**

* A more powerful version of `Future`
* Supports **chaining**, **combining**, and **async execution**
* Perfect for **asynchronous pipelines**

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
                 .thenApply(s -> s + " World")
                 .thenAccept(System.out::println);
```

---

### 8. **Virtual Threads (Java 21)**

* Lightweight threads that scale to millions
* Part of **Project Loom**
* Use like:

```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
   System.out.println("Virtual thread running");
});
```

## ðŸ§ª When to Use What?

| Scenario                                       | Tool                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Thread-safe counter                            | `AtomicInteger`            |
| Execute tasks in parallel                      | `ExecutorService`          |
| Limit resource access (e.g., 3 DB connections) | `Semaphore`                |
| Wait for multiple threads                      | `CountDownLatch`           |
| Schedule repeated tasks                        | `ScheduledExecutorService` |
| Avoid synchronized blocks                      | `ReentrantLock`, `Atomic*` |
| Efficient thread-safe maps                     | `ConcurrentHashMap`        |
| Async workflows                                | `CompletableFuture`        |
| Millions of lightweight threads                | Virtual Threads (Java 21+) |
