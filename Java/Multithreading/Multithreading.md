Absolutely! Let’s dive **deep** into the **first and most foundational part** of multithreading in Java:

---

## 🟢 **1. Introduction to Multithreading**

---

### ✅ **What is a Thread?**

A **thread** is a lightweight, independent path of execution within a process.

In Java, every program runs at least one thread: the **main thread**.

#### 🔧 Analogy:

> Think of a *process* as a restaurant, and each *thread* as a waiter — multiple waiters can serve different tables (tasks) simultaneously in the same restaurant (process).

---

### ✅ **Process vs Thread**

| Feature       | Process                                 | Thread                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Definition    | Independent unit of execution           | Sub-unit of a process              |
| Memory        | Has its own memory space (heap, stack)  | Shares memory with other threads   |
| Overhead      | Heavy (OS context switch)               | Light                              |
| Communication | Difficult (Inter-Process Communication) | Easy (shared memory)               |
| Crash Impact  | One process crash doesn't affect others | One thread crash may affect others |

---

### ✅ **Advantages of Multithreading**

1. **Improved performance** (parallelism)

   * Utilize multi-core CPUs efficiently.
2. **Responsiveness**

   * UI remains smooth while background tasks run.
3. **Better resource utilization**

   * CPU can execute other threads while one waits (I/O, DB).
4. **Simplified modeling**

   * Real-world concurrency like chat apps, servers, games.
5. **Scalability**

   * Ideal for web servers and microservices with thread pools.

---

### ✅ **When and Why to Use Threads**

| Use Case                            | Why Threads?                            |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| File downloads, uploads             | Prevent UI freeze, run in background    |
| Web or database servers             | Handle many users/requests concurrently |
| Real-time applications (games, IoT) | Need continuous updates/rendering       |
| Data processing                     | Parallel stream/data crunching          |
| Scheduled tasks                     | Repetitive execution (cron jobs)        |

---

### ✅ **Life Cycle of a Thread**

A Java thread goes through several **well-defined states** during its lifetime:

#### 🧬 Life Cycle Diagram:

```
          NEW
           |
           v (start())
       RUNNABLE
        /   \
       /     \
   BLOCKED   WAITING
       \     /
        v   v
    TERMINATED
```

---

### ✅ **Thread States in Java (`java.lang.Thread.State`)**

| State           | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEW`           | Thread is created but not yet started                                                             |
| `RUNNABLE`      | Thread is eligible to run (may or may not be running, depending on the scheduler)                 |
| `BLOCKED`       | Thread is waiting to acquire a lock (e.g., `synchronized`)                                        |
| `WAITING`       | Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to signal (`wait()` / `join()` without timeout) |
| `TIMED_WAITING` | Thread is waiting for a specified time (`sleep()`, `join(1000)`, `wait(5000)`)                    |
| `TERMINATED`    | Thread has completed or terminated due to an exception                                            |

---

### ✅ Example: Thread Lifecycle in Code

```java
public class ThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread is running...");
        });

        System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW

        t.start();
        System.out.println(t.getState()); // RUNNABLE or TERMINATED (depends on timing)
    }
}
```

### 🧠 Key Concepts to Remember

| Concept                    | Meaning                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Thread is lightweight      | Shares process memory; creation cost is low       |
| Multithreading ≠ multicore | JVM switches threads rapidly on even one CPU      |
| Not all tasks benefit      | CPU-bound tasks may need careful thread design    |
| Threads need management    | Too many threads can slow the system (use pools!) |

---
Absolutely! Let’s take a **deep dive** into the different ways of **creating threads in Java**, which is the most fundamental skill in multithreaded programming. 🔍

---

## 🟢 **2. Creating Threads in Java**

Java provides multiple ways to create and run threads. All of them revolve around the **`java.lang.Thread`** class or the **`Runnable`** interface.

---

### ✅ 1. **Extending the `Thread` Class**

You can create a new thread by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Usage:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();  // Thread is in NEW state
        t1.start(); // Starts a new thread, executes run() in a new call stack
    }
}
```

---

### ⚠️ `start()` vs `run()` ⚠️

| Method    | Behavior                                                                |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start()` | Starts a **new thread** and invokes `run()` in that thread              |
| `run()`   | Just a normal method call; runs on the **current thread** (main thread) |

```java
t1.run();   // ❌ Not multithreaded (runs in main thread)
t1.start(); // ✅ New thread is spawned
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Implementing the `Runnable` Interface**

This is a **better and more flexible approach** — especially when:

* You want to **extend another class**
* You want to **reuse the same logic** across different threads

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Usage:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(task);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Using Lambda Expression (Java 8+)**

If you're using Java 8+, and your `Runnable` is simple, you can use a lambda.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Running with lambda on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        t1.start();
    }
}
```

This is **compact, clean, and modern**.

---

### ✅ When to Use Which?

| Approach          | When to Use                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Thread` subclass | Rarely; if you're customizing `Thread` class or learning basics |
| `Runnable`        | Preferred; for separation of task and thread                    |
| Lambda            | Best for simple, inline tasks (Java 8+)                         |

---

### ✅ Thread Naming and Priority (optional)

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Worker-1");
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // Optional
t.start();
```

---

### 🧠 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                              | Why it's wrong                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Calling `run()` instead of `start()` | Doesn't start a new thread        |
| Reusing a thread instance            | A thread can be started only once |
| Not handling exceptions in `run()`   | May crash silently                |

---

### ✅ Example: Multiple Threads Using Runnable

```java
class PrintTask implements Runnable {
    private String name;

    public PrintTask(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println(name + " started by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new PrintTask("Task 1"));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new PrintTask("Task 2"));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

| Method                  | Starts new thread? | Reusable? | Recommended? |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| `Thread.run()`          | ❌                  | ✅         | ❌            |

| Implementing `Runnable` | ✅                  | ✅         | ✅            |
| Lambda (`Runnable`)     | ✅                  | ✅         | ✅✅✅          |

---

Absolutely! Let's go deep into the **core thread methods** in Java — these methods give you direct control over thread **timing**, **cooperation**, and **monitoring**.

---

## 🟡 **3. Thread Methods (Deep Dive)**

---

### ✅ 1. `Thread.sleep(long millis)`

**Pauses** the current thread for a given time (in milliseconds). It’s a **static method**, so it always affects the thread that **calls it**, not the thread it's called on.

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
Thread.sleep(1000); // sleeps for 1 second
```

#### 💡 Use Case:

To simulate delay (like API calls, processing) or control thread timing.

#### 🧠 Notes:

* Throws `InterruptedException`, so must be in a try-catch.
* **Doesn’t release locks** if inside a `synchronized` block.
* Other threads keep running.

```java
try {
    System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    Thread.sleep(2000);
    System.out.println("Awake!");
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. `join()`

**Waits** for another thread to finish. It’s like saying: “Wait until this thread is done before continuing.”

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
thread.join(); // wait until 'thread' finishes
```

#### 🧠 Use Case:

Ensure a thread completes before continuing. Great for **dependency order** in multithreading.

#### 🔧 Example:

```java
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("T1 starts");
    try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch (Exception e) {}
    System.out.println("T1 ends");
});

t1.start();

try {
    t1.join(); // main waits for t1 to finish
    System.out.println("Main continues after T1");
} catch (InterruptedException e) {}
```

#### 🧠 Notes:

* Has overloads like `join(long millis)` to wait only for a limited time.
* Can throw `InterruptedException`.

---

### ✅ 3. `yield()`

**Hints** to the thread scheduler: "I'm willing to pause and let others run."

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
Thread.yield();
```

#### 🧠 Notes:

* It’s a **static** method and affects the **current thread**.
* It **does not guarantee** that the current thread will pause — it’s just a **suggestion** to the JVM.
* Rarely used in real applications.

---

### ✅ 4. `setPriority(int priority)` and `getPriority()`

Every Java thread has a priority between **1 (MIN)** and **10 (MAX)**. Default is **5 (NORM\_PRIORITY)**.

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(...);
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // 10

int p = t.getPriority(); // returns current priority
```

#### 🧠 Notes:

* Priority may influence thread scheduling but **is not guaranteed** across OSes.
* Some platforms (like Windows) may respect it, but most don't in Java.
* Better to rely on thread pools or Executors for real control.

---

### ✅ 5. `isAlive()`

Checks if a thread is still running or not.

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(...);
t.start();

System.out.println(t.isAlive()); // true if running or waiting
```

#### 🧠 Notes:

* Returns `true` if the thread has started and hasn’t finished.
* Returns `false` if it’s in `NEW` or `TERMINATED` state.

---

### ✅ 6. `currentThread()`

Returns a reference to the currently executing thread.

#### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
System.out.println("Running in: " + t.getName());
```

#### 🧠 Use Case:

* Useful for logging, debugging, or applying thread-local logic.
* Can use `currentThread().setName("Worker")` to label the thread.

---

### 🔁 Putting It All Together — Real Example

```java
public class ThreadMethodsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("T1 running");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                System.out.println("T1 yielding");
                Thread.yield();
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                System.out.println("T1 done");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        });

        t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
        t1.start();

        System.out.println("Main waiting for T1");
        t1.join();
        System.out.println("Is T1 alive? " + t1.isAlive());
        System.out.println("Main finished on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

## ✅ Summary Table

| Method            | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `sleep(ms)`       | Pauses current thread for a time     |
| `join()`          | Waits for another thread to finish   |
| `yield()`         | Suggests to pause and let others run |
| `setPriority()`   | Sets thread priority                 |
| `getPriority()`   | Gets current priority                |
| `isAlive()`       | Checks if a thread is still running  |
| `currentThread()` | Gets reference to the running thread |

---

Let's now go **deep** into the engine behind how threads are **scheduled and managed** inside the JVM and OS. Understanding **Thread Scheduling & Life Cycle** is crucial for building efficient, bug-free multithreaded applications.

---

## 🟡 **4. Thread Scheduling & Life Cycle**

---

### ✅ 1. **Time-Slicing and Context Switching**

---

#### ⏱️ **Time-Slicing (a.k.a. Time Sharing)**

* The CPU gives each thread a **"time slice"** to execute (a few milliseconds).
* After the slice ends, the thread is paused and another thread gets CPU time.
* Gives the **illusion of parallelism** on a single-core processor.

> Think of it like giving each student a turn to speak during a discussion — only one speaks at a time, but everyone gets a turn rapidly.

---

#### 🔁 **Context Switching**

* When the CPU switches from one thread to another:

  * It saves the current thread’s **state (registers, stack, etc.)**
  * Loads the next thread’s state
* This has **performance cost** (switching overhead).

🔧 More threads ≠ faster — too many threads = too much context switching = **slowdown**.

---

### ✅ 2. **Daemon Threads vs User Threads**

---

#### 🔵 **User Threads**

* **Default** type of thread (e.g., main thread)
* Keeps the **JVM alive** until all user threads are finished

#### ⚪ **Daemon Threads**

* Background threads that **do not prevent JVM shutdown**
* JVM will **terminate** as soon as all **user threads finish**, even if daemon threads are still running

#### 🔧 Set a thread as daemon:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> { ... });
t.setDaemon(true);
```

#### 🔥 Examples:

* Garbage Collector
* Background tasks like logging, monitoring

🔴 **Important**: You must call `setDaemon(true)` **before** `start()`.

---

### ✅ 3. **Thread Priority and Fairness**

---

Each thread in Java can have a **priority (1 to 10)**:

```java
Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5 (default)
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY = 10
```

#### 🔧 Usage:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {});
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
```

#### ⚠️ Note:

* Thread priority is just a **hint** to the OS scheduler.
* JVM doesn’t **guarantee** that higher-priority threads run first.
* Behavior is **platform-dependent** and **unpredictable**.

---

### ✅ 4. **Preemptive vs Cooperative Multitasking**

---

| Type            | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Preemptive**  | The **OS decides** when to switch threads (most systems, including Java) |
| **Cooperative** | The thread itself **voluntarily yields** control (less common today)     |

#### Java Uses: **Preemptive Scheduling**

But we can request:

```java
Thread.yield(); // Suggests giving up CPU
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Thread Lifecycle Methods & States**

---

#### 📌 States (via `Thread.State` enum)

| State           | Description                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEW`           | Thread created, not started yet                                    |
| `RUNNABLE`      | Eligible to run, waiting for CPU                                   |
| `BLOCKED`       | Waiting for a **lock/monitor** (e.g., another thread has the lock) |
| `WAITING`       | Waiting **indefinitely** (`wait()`, `join()` with no timeout)      |
| `TIMED_WAITING` | Waiting for a **limited time** (`sleep()`, `join(1000)`)           |
| `TERMINATED`    | Thread has completed or crashed                                    |

---

#### 🔧 Useful Lifecycle Methods

| Method      | Use                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `start()`   | Moves from NEW → RUNNABLE                        |
| `sleep(ms)` | Moves RUNNABLE → TIMED\_WAITING                  |
| `join()`    | Main thread waits until target thread finishes   |
| `yield()`   | Suggests giving up CPU time                      |
| `isAlive()` | Returns true if thread is alive (not terminated) |

---

### 🔍 Code Example Showing Lifecycle

```java
public class LifecycleDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Running");
            try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch (Exception e) {}
        });

        System.out.println("State: " + t.getState()); // NEW

        t.start();
        System.out.println("State after start(): " + t.getState()); // RUNNABLE

        Thread.sleep(100);
        System.out.println("State after sleep(100): " + t.getState()); // TIMED_WAITING

        t.join();
        System.out.println("State after join(): " + t.getState()); // TERMINATED
    }
}
```

Excellent! This is one of the **most critical** sections in multithreading: how to ensure **thread safety** and avoid bugs like **race conditions**, which are notoriously hard to debug.

---

## 🟠 **5. Synchronization & Thread Safety (Deep Dive)**

---

### ✅ 1. **Race Conditions and Data Inconsistency**

---

A **race condition** occurs when **two or more threads access shared data at the same time**, and the **final outcome depends on the timing** of their execution.

#### 🔥 Example of Race Condition:

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

If 10 threads call `increment()` at the same time, the final value of `count` may not be 10!
👉 **Why?** Because `count++` is **not atomic** – it breaks down into:

1. Read value
2. Add 1
3. Write back

#### 🔴 Consequences:

* Data corruption
* Incorrect results
* Inconsistent behavior

---

### ✅ 2. **Synchronized Methods and Blocks**

---

Java provides the `synchronized` keyword to allow **only one thread** to execute a block or method at a time on the **same object**.

### 🔹 Synchronized Method:

```java
public synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}
```

### 🔹 Synchronized Block:

```java
public void increment() {
    synchronized(this) {
        count++;
    }
}
```

You can also synchronize on any custom lock:

```java
private final Object lock = new Object();

public void increment() {
    synchronized(lock) {
        count++;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Intrinsic Locks / Monitor Locks**

---

Every object in Java has an **intrinsic lock** (a.k.a. monitor lock).

When a thread enters a `synchronized` block/method:

* It **acquires the lock** of that object.
* Other threads are **blocked** until the lock is released.

🧠 If multiple threads synchronize on the **same object**, only one can hold the lock.

---

### ✅ 4. **Reentrant Locks**

---

The **Reentrant Lock** from `java.util.concurrent.locks` provides more **advanced control** than `synchronized`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

public void increment() {
    lock.lock();   // Acquire lock manually
    try {
        count++;
    } finally {
        lock.unlock(); // Always release!
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Benefits over `synchronized`:

* Try acquiring (`tryLock()`)
* Interruptible lock waits
* Fairness policies (FIFO)
* Non-blocking attempts

---

### ✅ 5. **Lock Interface (Manual Locking)**

---

`Lock` is an interface that `ReentrantLock` implements. Unlike `synchronized`, it gives:

| Feature             | Lock       | synchronized |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Interruptible waits | ✅          | ❌            |
| Try acquiring lock  | ✅          | ❌            |
| Time-bound attempts | ✅          | ❌            |
| Fairness control    | ✅          | ❌            |
| Auto release        | ❌ (manual) | ✅            |

Always use:

```java
lock.lock();
try {
   // critical section
} finally {
   lock.unlock(); // 🔥 Must release lock manually!
}
```

---

### ✅ 6. **Volatile Keyword**

---

`volatile` ensures **visibility** of variable changes across threads.

```java
private volatile boolean flag = false;
```

Without `volatile`, changes made by one thread **may not be visible** to others due to CPU-level caching.

🔧 **Volatile ≠ Atomic**
It doesn’t protect compound operations like `x++`. For that, use `synchronized` or atomic classes.

---

### ✅ 7. **Atomic Variables (java.util.concurrent.atomic)**

---

Atomic classes provide **lock-free, thread-safe** operations.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

public void increment() {
    count.incrementAndGet(); // atomic operation
}
```

#### ✅ Common Atomic Classes:

* `AtomicInteger`
* `AtomicBoolean`
* `AtomicLong`
* `AtomicReference<T>`

These are **faster** and **scalable** alternatives to using `synchronized` when simple atomic operations are enough.

---

### 🔍 When to Use What?

| Problem Type             | Solution                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Shared counter           | `AtomicInteger`                   |
| Complex critical section | `synchronized` or `ReentrantLock` |
| Read-mostly config       | `volatile`                        |
| Fair thread access       | `ReentrantLock(true)`             |
| Interruptible tasks      | `Lock.lockInterruptibly()`        |

---

### 🔁 Complete Code Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class SafeCounter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

| Topic           | Purpose                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Race condition  | When multiple threads modify shared data unsafely |
| `synchronized`  | Locks critical section automatically              |
| `ReentrantLock` | Advanced locking with manual control              |
| `volatile`      | Guarantees visibility across threads              |
| `AtomicInteger` | Lock-free thread-safe counter                     |

---

You're now entering one of the most **powerful but complex** parts of Java multithreading: **inter-thread communication**. This is how threads **talk to each other** and **coordinate access** to shared resources **without constantly locking or polling**.

Let’s break down the key concepts one by one.

---

## 🟠 **6. Inter-Thread Communication (Deep Dive)**

---

### ✅ 1. `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()` — **Object Monitor Methods**

These methods are defined in the `Object` class, not `Thread`.

They are used for **low-level thread coordination** — like **one thread waits** for a condition, and another thread **notifies** it when the condition is true.

---

### 🔧 `wait()`

* Called by a thread **inside a synchronized block**
* Causes the thread to:

  * **Release the monitor lock**
  * Enter the **WAITING** state until notified

```java
synchronized (lock) {
    while (!condition) {
        lock.wait(); // Releases lock and waits
    }
}
```

---

### 🔧 `notify()`

* Wakes up **one** thread that is waiting on the monitor of this object.
* Doesn’t release the lock immediately — does so when the `synchronized` block finishes.

```java
synchronized (lock) {
    condition = true;
    lock.notify(); // Wakes up one thread
}
```

---

### 🔧 `notifyAll()`

* Wakes up **all** waiting threads.
* Only one can acquire the lock once it's free.

---

### 🔴 Important:

* Must be called **inside a synchronized block**.
* Otherwise, throws `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

---

### ✅ 2. **Producer-Consumer Problem (Classic Pattern)**

---

This problem models:

* **Producer**: generates data
* **Consumer**: consumes that data
* Both work in **parallel**, and use a **shared queue/buffer**

---

### 🔁 Using `wait()` / `notify()`:

```java
class SharedBuffer {
    private int data;
    private boolean hasValue = false;

    public synchronized void produce(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while (hasValue) {
            wait(); // wait if buffer full
        }
        data = value;
        hasValue = true;
        System.out.println("Produced: " + value);
        notify(); // notify consumer
    }

    public synchronized int consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!hasValue) {
            wait(); // wait if buffer empty
        }
        hasValue = false;
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + data);
        notify(); // notify producer
        return data;
    }
}
```

```java
// Producer Thread
new Thread(() -> {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        try {
            buffer.produce(i);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    }
}).start();

// Consumer Thread
new Thread(() -> {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        try {
            buffer.consume();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    }
}).start();
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Low-Level Monitor Methods Recap**

| Method        | What it does                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `wait()`      | Releases lock, puts thread into WAITING state   |
| `notify()`    | Wakes up 1 thread waiting on this object's lock |
| `notifyAll()` | Wakes up all waiting threads                    |

🔴 Must be used with `synchronized`

---

### ✅ 4. **Spurious Wakeups & Best Practices**

---

#### 🔥 What is a Spurious Wakeup?

Sometimes, a thread may **wake up from `wait()`** even if it **was not notified**.

This is allowed by JVM spec for performance optimization.

---

#### ✅ Best Practice: Always Use `wait()` in a Loop

```java
synchronized (lock) {
    while (!condition) {
        lock.wait(); // re-check condition after wake-up
    }
}
```

* Ensures that the condition is **rechecked**
* Protects against **spurious wakeups**
* Allows correct **wait-notify coordination**

---

### ✅ Summary: Key Rules

| ✅ Rule                                                  | 🔍 Why                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Call `wait()`, `notify()` only in `synchronized` block  | They need monitor ownership                          |
| Always use `wait()` inside a loop                       | Prevents issues from spurious wakeups                |
| Prefer `notifyAll()` over `notify()` in complex systems | More reliable when multiple threads wait             |
| Don't use `wait()`/`notify()` on different lock objects | It won’t work — threads must use the **same object** |

---

### 🚀 Want a Better Way?

You can avoid this low-level complexity using:

* **`BlockingQueue`** in `java.util.concurrent` (for producer-consumer)
* **`CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, `Phaser`**, etc.

But knowing `wait()`/`notify()` is **essential for interviews and foundational understanding**.

---

Great! Let’s dive into **Thread Groups** and **ThreadLocal**, two lesser-known but **important features** in Java multithreading—especially in **frameworks** and **real-world applications** like web servers and logging.

---

## 🔵 **7. Thread Groups and ThreadLocal (Deep Dive)**

---

### ✅ **1. Thread Groups**

---

#### 🎯 **What is a Thread Group?**

* A `ThreadGroup` is a **mechanism to group multiple threads** together into a **logical unit**.
* You can **control** (start, stop, monitor) all threads in the group at once.
* Mainly used for **management**, **security policies**, or **profiling/debugging**.

#### 📦 Structure

```java
ThreadGroup parentGroup = new ThreadGroup("Parent Group");
ThreadGroup childGroup = new ThreadGroup(parentGroup, "Child Group");

Thread t1 = new Thread(childGroup, "Worker-1");
Thread t2 = new Thread(childGroup, "Worker-2");
```

#### 🔧 Common Methods

| Method                     | Purpose                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `activeCount()`            | Number of active threads in the group |
| `list()`                   | Print thread group hierarchy          |
| `interrupt()`              | Interrupt all threads in the group    |
| `enumerate(Thread[] list)` | Populate array with active threads    |

#### ⚠️ **Why It's Rarely Used Today**

* Was useful in **early versions of Java**
* **Superseded by `ExecutorService`, thread pools, etc.**
* You **can’t stop or suspend** threads safely through groups anymore

✅ **Still used** in:

* Some **custom frameworks**
* **Security managers**
* Diagnostic tools

---

### ✅ **2. `ThreadLocal` — Per-Thread Data Storage**

---

#### 🎯 **What is `ThreadLocal`?**

* A special Java class that allows you to store **data that is local to a thread**.
* Each thread accessing a `ThreadLocal` gets its **own separate copy** of the variable.

> You can think of it like thread-specific global variables.

#### 📦 Basic Example

```java
ThreadLocal<Integer> threadId = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);

threadId.set(42); // only visible to current thread
System.out.println(threadId.get());
```

* Each thread has its own value.
* Changes made by one thread are **not visible** to others.

---

#### ✅ Common Use Cases

| Scenario                        | Why use `ThreadLocal`?                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logging Correlation ID**      | Store a request ID in logs across methods           |
| **Web request scope**           | Store user/session/request context per thread       |
| **Date formatting**             | Reuse `SimpleDateFormat` (which is not thread-safe) |
| **Database connection context** | Thread-specific connection for transactions         |

---

#### 🔐 Real-World Web App Example (like Spring MVC)

```java
public class RequestContext {
    private static final ThreadLocal<String> currentUser = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void set(String userId) {
        currentUser.set(userId);
    }

    public static String get() {
        return currentUser.get();
    }

    public static void clear() {
        currentUser.remove();
    }
}
```

You can set the user ID at the beginning of request processing and access it **anywhere in the same thread**, even in unrelated methods.

---

### ✅ ⚠️ Best Practices for `ThreadLocal`

* ✅ Always call `remove()` when the thread finishes (especially in **thread pools**), or you get **memory leaks**.
* ❌ Don’t use as a **cache** or **singleton**
* ❌ Avoid nesting or overusing — leads to code that's hard to debug

---

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Concept       | Purpose                          | Real Use                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `ThreadGroup` | Manage multiple threads together | Debugging, monitoring                  |
| `ThreadLocal` | Thread-specific variable storage | Logging, request context, transactions |

---

You're now entering the **modern, real-world-friendly way** of handling multithreading in Java: the **Executor Framework**. It solves the problems of manual thread management and provides **powerful thread pooling**, **task management**, and **asynchronous programming**.

---

## 🔵 **8. Executor Framework (High-Level API) – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ 1. **Why Executor Framework?**

Before Java 5, we manually created and managed threads:

```java
new Thread(() -> doWork()).start();
```

Problems:

* No control over how many threads run
* No reuse → new thread each time = costly
* Hard to manage or monitor

✅ Solution: **Executor Framework** = Pooling + Scheduling + Asynchronous control

---

## ✅ 2. `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`

---

### 🔹 `Executor` (interface)

Simplest form. You just **submit tasks** and it executes them:

```java
Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Task executed"));
```

### 🔹 `ExecutorService` (extends `Executor`)

Adds:

* Task submission with result tracking (`submit`)
* Shutdown control
* `invokeAll()` / `invokeAny()`

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
pool.submit(() -> System.out.println("Running in pool"));
```

### 🔹 `ScheduledExecutorService`

For **delayed** or **periodic** task execution (like cron jobs):

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
scheduler.schedule(() -> System.out.println("Delayed"), 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

---

## ✅ 3. Thread Pools

Use `Executors` utility class to create different pools.

---

### 🔹 `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n)`

* Reuses `n` threads
* Good for **CPU-bound** tasks

```java
ExecutorService fixed = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
```

---

### 🔹 `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`

* Creates threads as needed, reuses idle ones
* Good for **many short-lived** tasks

```java
ExecutorService cached = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
```

---

### 🔹 `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()`

* Single thread executes tasks sequentially
* Useful for **ordered tasks**

```java
ExecutorService single = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

---

### 🔹 `Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(n)`

* For scheduled/delayed tasks (like a timer)

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
```

---

## ✅ 4. `submit()` vs `execute()`

| Method                | Use Case         | Returns     |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `execute(Runnable)`   | Fire-and-forget  | void        |
| `submit(Runnable)`    | Track execution  | `Future<?>` |
| `submit(Callable<T>)` | Task with result | `Future<T>` |

Example:

```java
Future<Integer> result = pool.submit(() -> 42);
System.out.println(result.get()); // waits for result
```

---

## ✅ 5. `Callable` and `Future`

---

### 🔹 `Runnable` vs `Callable`

| Runnable            | Callable                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `run()`             | `call()`                     |
| No return           | Returns a value              |
| Can’t throw checked | Can throw checked exceptions |

```java
Callable<String> task = () -> "Hello from thread!";
Future<String> future = pool.submit(task);
```

---

### 🔹 `Future<T>`

Used to:

* Get result with `get()`
* Cancel the task with `cancel(true)`
* Check completion with `isDone()`

---

### 🔹 Example:

```java
Callable<Integer> square = () -> 5 * 5;
Future<Integer> result = pool.submit(square);
System.out.println("Answer: " + result.get()); // blocks until done
```

---

## ✅ 6. `invokeAll()` and `invokeAny()`

---

### 🔹 `invokeAll(Collection<Callable>)`

* Submits a list of `Callable` tasks
* Waits for **all to finish**
* Returns a list of `Future<T>`

```java
List<Callable<String>> tasks = List.of(
  () -> "Task1", () -> "Task2", () -> "Task3"
);
List<Future<String>> results = pool.invokeAll(tasks);
```

---

### 🔹 `invokeAny(Collection<Callable>)`

* Returns the result of **first successfully completed** task
* Cancels others
* Faster in **redundant execution** scenarios

```java
String result = pool.invokeAny(tasks);
```

---

## 🔐 Shutdown Executor Properly

Always shut down executors to avoid app hanging:

```java
pool.shutdown(); // allow tasks to finish
// or
pool.shutdownNow(); // interrupt ongoing tasks
```

---

## 🧠 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                    | What to Use                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Web server request handling | `FixedThreadPool`          |
| Background job scheduler    | `ScheduledExecutorService` |
| Async computation result    | `Callable + Future`        |
| Retry / race logic          | `invokeAny()`              |

---

## 🚫 Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Forgetting to shutdown → memory leaks
* ❌ Blocking forever on `Future.get()` → always add timeout
* ❌ Using `new Thread()` for every task

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Concept                    | Purpose                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Executor`                 | Basic interface to run tasks       |
| `ExecutorService`          | Submit, manage, and control tasks  |
| `ScheduledExecutorService` | Schedule tasks with delay          |
| `Callable`                 | Task with return value             |
| `Future`                   | Access result of async task        |
| `invokeAll()`              | Run many tasks and wait for all    |
| `invokeAny()`              | Return result of the first success |

---

You're now diving into the **heart of thread pool internals**: the `ThreadPoolExecutor` — the **powerful, low-level engine** behind all the thread pools created via `Executors.newXyz()`.

Understanding `ThreadPoolExecutor` gives you **fine-grained control** over:

* Thread creation
* Task queuing
* Rejection handling
* Custom monitoring and tuning

---

## 🔵 **9. `ThreadPoolExecutor` – Advanced Control (Deep Dive)**

---

### ✅ **What is `ThreadPoolExecutor`?**

`ThreadPoolExecutor` is the **concrete class** that powers:

* `FixedThreadPool`
* `CachedThreadPool`
* `ScheduledThreadPool` (via subclass)

It gives you **full control over pooling behavior**, unlike the simple `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`.

You can create it directly:

```java
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    corePoolSize,           // core threads
    maximumPoolSize,        // max threads
    keepAliveTime,          // time to keep extra threads alive
    timeUnit,               // time unit
    workQueue,              // task queue
    threadFactory,          // (optional) custom thread creator
    handler                 // (optional) rejection policy
);
```

---

## 🔹 1. **Core vs Maximum Threads**

| Type              | Meaning                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `corePoolSize`    | Minimum threads kept alive (even idle) |
| `maximumPoolSize` | Max threads created during high load   |

🔄 **Flow Example:**

1. Tasks come in → use core threads
2. Core full → tasks go to queue
3. Queue full → create threads up to maxPoolSize
4. Max reached + queue full → apply rejection policy

---

### 🧠 Example:

```java
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    2,               // core threads
    4,               // max threads
    10,              // keep-alive time
    TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2)  // task queue
);
```

* 2 threads always alive
* Can grow to 4 under load
* Extra threads (3rd, 4th) die after 10 seconds idle

---

## 🔹 2. **Keep-Alive Time**

* Applies to **non-core** threads
* If idle for this long, they get terminated
* You can apply it to **core threads** as well:

```java
executor.allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true);
```

---

## 🔹 3. **Task Queue Types (`BlockingQueue`)**

| Queue Type              | Behavior                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ArrayBlockingQueue`    | Fixed-size, bounded                       |
| `LinkedBlockingQueue`   | Unbounded (risk of OOM)                   |
| `SynchronousQueue`      | No queue — hand-off to thread immediately |
| `PriorityBlockingQueue` | Tasks ordered by priority                 |
| `DelayQueue`            | For delayed scheduling                    |

✅ Choosing the right queue type changes how the pool behaves under load.

---

### 🧠 Common Config Patterns:

| Pool Type           | Configuration                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| FixedThreadPool     | core = max, unbounded queue         |
| CachedThreadPool    | core = 0, max = ∞, SynchronousQueue |
| ScheduledThreadPool | DelayQueue + worker threads         |

---

## 🔹 4. **RejectedExecutionHandler**

When all threads are busy **and the queue is full**, what should happen?

You choose this via a `RejectedExecutionHandler`:

| Handler                 | Behavior                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `AbortPolicy` (default) | Throws `RejectedExecutionException` |
| `CallerRunsPolicy`      | Runs the task in **calling thread** |
| `DiscardPolicy`         | Silently discards the task          |
| `DiscardOldestPolicy`   | Discards oldest task in queue       |

### ✅ Example:

```java
executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```

---

## 🔹 5. **Custom ThreadFactory**

Customize:

* Thread names
* Daemon status
* Priority

### ✅ Example:

```java
ThreadFactory factory = runnable -> {
    Thread t = new Thread(runnable);
    t.setName("MyWorker-" + t.getId());
    t.setDaemon(false);
    return t;
};

ThreadPoolExecutor pool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    2, 4, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10),
    factory
);
```

> 📛 Naming threads helps in debugging logs and monitoring.

---

## 🔹 6. **Monitoring the Pool**

You can monitor the executor **at runtime** via its methods:

```java
System.out.println("Active Threads: " + executor.getActiveCount());
System.out.println("Pool Size: " + executor.getPoolSize());
System.out.println("Queue Size: " + executor.getQueue().size());
System.out.println("Completed Tasks: " + executor.getCompletedTaskCount());
```

---

### 🧠 Real-World Use Case

Imagine you're building a job processor like a **background email sender**:

* Use `ArrayBlockingQueue` to limit pending jobs
* Custom rejection handler to log failures
* Monitor pool to alert on overload

Absolutely! Let’s now dive deep into **Scheduled Thread Pools** in Java — an essential feature when you need to **schedule tasks to run at fixed intervals or after delays**, like **cron jobs, heartbeat monitoring**, or **repeated background tasks**.

---

## 🔵 **10. Scheduled Thread Pools – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ **What is a Scheduled Thread Pool?**

A **Scheduled Thread Pool** allows you to:

* Execute a task **after a delay**
* Execute a task **periodically** (fixed rate or fixed delay)
* Use **thread pooling** behind the scenes

It’s created via:

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(int nThreads);
```

📌 This gives you a **thread-safe**, **pool-backed**, flexible way to schedule tasks.

---

## ✅ **1. Running Delayed Tasks**

```java
scheduler.schedule(() -> {
    System.out.println("Executed after 3 seconds");
}, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

* Task runs once after the given delay.
* Does not repeat.

---

## ✅ **2. Running Periodic Tasks**

Java provides two powerful methods:

---

### 🔁 **scheduleAtFixedRate()**

```java
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, initialDelay, period, unit);
```

**Behavior:**

* Runs first after `initialDelay`
* Then **every `period`**, *regardless of how long the task took*
* If the task takes longer than the period, **next run is delayed but back-to-back**

✅ **Use When**: Time **between task starts** must be fixed (e.g., polling API every 10 seconds)

🧠 **Example**:

```java
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
    System.out.println("FixedRate: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
}, 0, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

---

### ⏳ **scheduleWithFixedDelay()**

```java
scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(task, initialDelay, delay, unit);
```

**Behavior:**

* Runs first after `initialDelay`
* Then waits until task **finishes**, then **waits for `delay`**, then starts again
* Time between runs = taskDuration + delay

✅ **Use When**: You want a **pause between tasks**, not between their start times (e.g., backup or cleanup after last completes)

🧠 **Example**:

```java
scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(() -> {
    System.out.println("FixedDelay: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
    try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
}, 0, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

---

## 🔍 **Comparison: FixedRate vs FixedDelay**

| Feature           | `scheduleAtFixedRate()` | `scheduleWithFixedDelay()` |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Next run time     | Based on **start time** | Based on **end time**      |
| Skips if delayed? | Might **queue tightly** | **Never overlaps**         |
| Use case          | Heartbeats, monitoring  | Cleanup, I/O, backups      |

---

## 🔐 Thread Safety & Pool Size

If you schedule multiple tasks and only use one thread in the pool, tasks can **delay each other**.

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); // only 1 thread!
```

✅ Best practice:

* Use more threads in the pool if multiple tasks run in parallel.
* Monitor `getActiveCount()`, `getQueue().size()` for signs of overloading.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario                        | How to Use                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Retry failed requests           | `scheduleWithFixedDelay()` |
| Ping health check every 10s     | `scheduleAtFixedRate()`    |
| Clean temp files hourly         | `scheduleWithFixedDelay()` |
| Database stats refresh every 5m | `scheduleAtFixedRate()`    |

---

## ✅ Sample Code: Monitoring Task

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);

scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
    System.out.println("🔄 Checking server health at " + LocalTime.now());
    // simulate time-consuming task
}, 0, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

---

## ⚠️ Shutdown Properly

Always shut down scheduled pools to avoid hanging:

```java
scheduler.shutdown();
```

---

| Feature                    | Description                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `schedule()`               | Run once after a delay                        |
| `scheduleAtFixedRate()`    | Fixed period between **start** of runs        |

Would you like:

* A real-world **heartbeat monitoring demo** using `scheduleAtFixedRate()`?
* Or should we proceed to 🔴 **11. Fork/Join Framework** (parallel divide-and-conquer)?

Great! You're now entering the **high-performance territory of parallel computing** in Java — the **Fork/Join Framework**. It's designed for **recursive, divide-and-conquer** algorithms that benefit from splitting work across multiple threads and then combining the results.

---

## 🔴 **11. Fork/Join Framework – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ **1. What is "Divide and Conquer"?**

**Divide and conquer** is a common programming paradigm where:

1. **Divide** the problem into smaller sub-problems.
2. **Conquer** each sub-problem recursively.
3. **Combine** the solutions to form the final result.

#### 🔁 Examples:

* Merge Sort
* Fibonacci computation
* Matrix multiplication
* Parallel search in arrays

---

## ✅ **2. Fork/Join Framework Overview**

The **Fork/Join Framework** in Java is introduced in **Java 7** to support parallelism in **divide-and-conquer** tasks.

It uses a **work-stealing algorithm** under the hood:

* Idle threads **steal** tasks from busy threads' queues → **maximizes CPU usage**

---

## ✅ **3. Key Classes**

| Class              | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ForkJoinPool`     | Specialized thread pool for divide-and-conquer |
| `RecursiveTask<V>` | Represents a task that **returns a result**    |
| `RecursiveAction`  | Represents a task that **returns no result**   |

---

## 🔧 Example: Recursive Sum Using `RecursiveTask`

```java
class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Long> {
    long[] arr;
    int start, end;

    SumTask(long[] arr, int start, int end) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Long compute() {
        if (end - start <= 1000) {  // base case
            long sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) sum += arr[i];
            return sum;
        } else {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            SumTask left = new SumTask(arr, start, mid);
            SumTask right = new SumTask(arr, mid, end);
            left.fork();                     // start asynchronously
            long rightResult = right.compute();  // compute right
            long leftResult = left.join();       // wait for left
            return leftResult + rightResult;
        }
    }
}
```

### Running it:

```java
ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
long total = pool.invoke(new SumTask(myArray, 0, myArray.length));
```

## ✅ 4. `ForkJoinPool` vs `ExecutorService`

| Feature         | ForkJoinPool                           | ExecutorService               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Task type       | Recursive, parallel, small subtasks    | Independent, arbitrary tasks  |
| Result handling | `join()`, `invoke()`                   | `Future.get()`                |
| Thread behavior | **Work stealing**                      | **Fixed threads**, FIFO       |
| Ideal use case  | Sorting, recursion, divide-and-conquer | Request handling, async tasks |

---

## ✅ 5. Use Cases

| Use Case                   | Description                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Merge Sort                 | Parallel sorting large arrays                 |
| File Search                | Recursively searching through directory trees |
| Big Data Aggregation       | Summing large data sets                       |
| Image Processing           | Applying filters to pixels in parallel        |
| Parallel Matrix Operations | Multiply or transpose in smaller tasks        |

---

## ✅ 6. RecursiveAction Example (No Return)

```java
class PrintTask extends RecursiveAction {
    int start, end;

    PrintTask(int start, int end) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        if ((end - start) <= 10) {
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) System.out.println(i);
        } else {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            invokeAll(new PrintTask(start, mid), new PrintTask(mid, end));
        }
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ 7. Real-World Example: Parallel Search

```java
class SearchTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    int[] arr;
    int start, end, target;

    public SearchTask(int[] arr, int start, int end, int target) {
        this.arr = arr; this.start = start; this.end = end; this.target = target;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= 100) {
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) if (arr[i] == target) return i;
            return -1;
        } else {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            SearchTask left = new SearchTask(arr, start, mid, target);
            SearchTask right = new SearchTask(arr, mid, end, target);
            left.fork();
            int rightResult = right.compute();
            int leftResult = left.join();
            return leftResult != -1 ? leftResult : rightResult;
        }
    }
}
```

## ✅ 8. Common Mistakes

| Mistake                         | Why it’s a problem                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Forking without join            | Task result never used                      |
| No base condition               | Leads to StackOverflow                      |
| Too many forks                  | Overhead and poor performance               |
| Not using parallelism threshold | Small tasks are cheaper to run sequentially |

---

## 📌 Summary Table

| Concept            | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ForkJoinPool`     | Efficient pool for recursive parallel tasks |
| `RecursiveTask<T>` | Task that returns a result                  |
| `RecursiveAction`  | Task with no result                         |
| `fork()`           | Run subtask in background                   |
| `join()`           | Wait and get result from forked task        |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Always define a **base condition** for stopping recursion.
* Use thresholds to **limit task splitting**.
* Use `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` if you don’t need custom configuration.
* Prefer **`invoke()`** over `submit()` in fork-join.

---

Would you like:

* A **mini project using ForkJoinPool** (e.g., parallel word count)?
* A comparison of Fork/Join with **Parallel Streams**?
* Or shall we proceed to 🔴 **12. Concurrency Utilities** (`CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, etc.)?

You're now entering one of the most **powerful and elegant** parts of Java's `java.util.concurrent` package — the **Concurrency Utilities**. These provide **fine-grained control** over thread coordination, synchronization, and advanced parallel flows — far beyond `synchronized` or `wait/notify`.

Let’s deep dive into each concept under:

---

## 🔴 **12. Concurrency Utilities – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ **1. `CountDownLatch`**

A **one-shot gate** that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations in other threads complete.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:

* Waiting for multiple threads to finish (e.g., test setup)
* Coordinating one-time start signal (e.g., start race when all ready)

#### ✅ Example:

```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

Runnable worker = () -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished");
        latch.countDown(); // reduce latch count
    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
};

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) new Thread(worker).start();

latch.await(); // main thread waits
System.out.println("All workers done, main continues");
```

---

### ✅ **2. `CyclicBarrier`**

A **barrier** that lets a set of threads wait for each other to reach a **common point** (called a *barrier*) and **then proceed together**. Can be reused.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:

* Parallel data processing (e.g., multithreaded matrix operations)
* Game phases (wait for all players to be ready before proceeding)

#### ✅ Example:

```java
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () -> {
    System.out.println("All reached barrier, let's continue!");
});

Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " ready");
    try {
        barrier.await(); // wait for others
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started task");
    } catch (Exception ignored) {}
};

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) new Thread(task).start();
```

---

### ✅ **3. `Semaphore`**

A **counter-based lock** that controls access to a **limited number of resources** (like permits). Unlike intrinsic locks, semaphores can grant access to multiple threads simultaneously.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:

* Limiting concurrent access (e.g., 3 users accessing a file)
* Controlling rate (e.g., thread pool limiter)

#### ✅ Example:

```java
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(2); // 2 permits

Runnable worker = () -> {
    try {
        semaphore.acquire(); // block if no permit
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired");
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
    finally {
        semaphore.release(); // give back permit
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " released");
    }
};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) new Thread(worker).start();
```

---

### ✅ **4. `Exchanger<T>`**

A thread synchronization point where **two threads can exchange objects**.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:

* Producer-consumer where both parties exchange data
* Hand-off between processing stages

#### ✅ Example:

```java
Exchanger<String> exchanger = new Exchanger<>();

Runnable task1 = () -> {
    try {
        String msg = exchanger.exchange("Hello from Thread 1");
        System.out.println("Thread 1 got: " + msg);
    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
};

Runnable task2 = () -> {
    try {
        String msg = exchanger.exchange("Hello from Thread 2");
        System.out.println("Thread 2 got: " + msg);
    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
};

new Thread(task1).start();
new Thread(task2).start();
```

---

### ✅ **5. `Phaser`**

A **more advanced, flexible barrier** than `CyclicBarrier`. It supports:

* **Dynamic registration** and deregistration of parties
* Multiple **phases** of execution

#### 🔧 Use Cases:

* Multi-stage pipeline (e.g., Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3)
* Tasks that participate in only some phases

#### ✅ Example:

```java
Phaser phaser = new Phaser(3); // 3 parties

Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " phase 1");
    phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();

    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " phase 2");
    phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
};

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) new Thread(task).start();
```

| Concept          | Real-World Analogy                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CountDownLatch` | Waiting for friends to arrive before leaving                |
| `CyclicBarrier`  | Waiting at a game lobby before starting                     |
| `Semaphore`      | Parking lot with limited spaces                             |
| `Exchanger`      | Handshake – you give and take                               |
| `Phaser`         | Relay race where runners must pass the baton for next phase |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

* Always call `release()`, `countDown()`, etc., in `finally` blocks.
* Prefer higher-level concurrency utilities over low-level `wait/notify`.
* Monitor deadlocks or blocking using tools like **VisualVM**, **jconsole**, or **thread dumps**.

---

Would you like:

* A mini project using these utilities (e.g., thread-safe multiplayer game lobby)?
* Move on to 🔴 **13. Concurrent Collections**?
* Or go deeper into one of the utilities with use-case modeling?

Awesome! You're now diving into the 🔥 **powerhouse tools** of thread-safe Java — the **Concurrent Collections** in `java.util.concurrent`. These collections are designed to **avoid race conditions** and allow **safe, efficient access** in multithreaded environments **without blocking the whole structure** like legacy synchronized collections (`Vector`, `Hashtable`).

Let’s **deep dive into each one**:

---

## 🔴 **13. Concurrent Collections – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ 1. `ConcurrentHashMap<K, V>`

A high-performance, **thread-safe** alternative to `HashMap`.

#### 🔧 Key Features:

* Allows **concurrent read/write** without locking the entire map.
* Uses **bucket-based segmentation** (internally via CAS + synchronized).
* Lock-free **read operations**, fine-grained **write locks**.

#### 🧠 Why not use `Collections.synchronizedMap()`?

Because it **locks the entire map** even for reading.

#### ✅ Example:

```java
ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put("apple", 1);

map.computeIfAbsent("banana", k -> 2);
map.putIfAbsent("apple", 10); // won't overwrite

System.out.println(map.get("apple")); // 1
```

✅ Ideal for: Caches, counting frequencies, thread-safe maps.

---

### ✅ 2. `CopyOnWriteArrayList<E>`

A **thread-safe version of `ArrayList`** optimized for **frequent reads and rare writes**.

#### 🔧 How it works:

* On write, it **creates a fresh copy** of the underlying array.
* Reads are **lock-free**, writes are **costly**.

#### ✅ Example:

```java
CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
list.add("A");
list.add("B");

for (String s : list) {
    list.add("C"); // ✅ No `ConcurrentModificationException`
    System.out.println(s);
}
```

✅ Ideal for: Read-heavy use cases like configuration data, observer lists.

---

### ✅ 3. `BlockingQueue<E>` – Interface

Supports **blocking operations**:

* `put()` → waits if full
* `take()` → waits if empty

Perfect for **Producer-Consumer** scenarios.

### ▶ Subtypes:

---

#### ✅ `ArrayBlockingQueue<E>`

* **Fixed-size**, array-backed.
* Fairness (`FIFO`) optional.

```java
BlockingQueue<String> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);
queue.put("task");        // blocks if full
String item = queue.take(); // blocks if empty
```

---

#### ✅ `LinkedBlockingQueue<E>`

* **Linked nodes**, optional bounded capacity.
* Better performance under high concurrency due to separate locks for put/take.

```java
BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(100);
```

✅ Ideal for: Background task queues, producer-consumer systems.

---

### ✅ 4. `PriorityBlockingQueue<E>`

A **thread-safe priority queue**. Items are ordered based on **natural order** or a **custom comparator**.

#### ✅ Example:

```java
PriorityBlockingQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityBlockingQueue<>();
pq.put(3);
pq.put(1);
pq.put(2);

System.out.println(pq.take()); // 1
System.out.println(pq.take()); // 2
System.out.println(pq.take()); // 3
```

🔁 It’s **unbounded** → `take()` blocks if empty, `put()` never blocks.

✅ Use for: Task scheduling, delayed jobs, real-time priority queues.

---

### ✅ 5. `ConcurrentLinkedQueue<E>`

A **non-blocking**, **lock-free** queue based on **linked nodes**.

* **FIFO** ordering
* Ideal for **high-performance, scalable queues**

#### ✅ Example:

```java
ConcurrentLinkedQueue<String> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
queue.offer("A");
queue.offer("B");

System.out.println(queue.poll()); // A
```

✅ Great for: Event buses, async logs, fast queueing systems.

---

### ✅ 6. `ConcurrentSkipListMap<K, V>`

A **thread-safe**, **sorted** map (like `TreeMap`) using a **skip list**.

* **Log(n)** time for operations
* Sorted ordering maintained across threads

#### ✅ Example:

```java
ConcurrentSkipListMap<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentSkipListMap<>();
map.put(10, "ten");
map.put(1, "one");

System.out.println(map.firstEntry()); // 1=one
```

✅ Ideal for: Real-time leaderboard, distributed cache systems.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `ConcurrentHashMap`     | High-concurrency map           | Fine-grained segments | ❌          | ❌        |

## ✅ Best Practices

* ✅ Use `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of `Hashtable` or synchronized map
* ✅ Use `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for observer/event lists (e.g., listeners)
* ✅ Prefer `BlockingQueue` over manual `wait/notify` for producer-consumer
* ❌ Don’t use CopyOnWrite collections if writes are frequent
* ❌ Avoid modifying collections during iteration unless explicitly supported

Would you like:

* A mini project using `BlockingQueue` and `ConcurrentHashMap` (e.g., task processor)?
* Move next to 🔴 **14. Advanced Topics** (Deadlocks, Livelocks)?
* Or revisit any concept in more depth?

You're now entering the **critical zone** of Java Multithreading:
**Advanced Topics** like **Deadlocks**, **Livelocks**, **Starvation**, and how to **analyze and fix performance bottlenecks** in multithreaded code. These topics are often **interview favorites** and **real-world issues** in production systems.

Let’s deep dive into each one:

---

## 🔴 **14. Advanced Multithreading Topics – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ 1. **Deadlocks**

#### 🔍 What is a Deadlock?

A **deadlock** occurs when **two or more threads are waiting for each other** to release resources they need, causing all of them to be stuck forever.

#### 🧠 4 Necessary Conditions for Deadlock:

1. **Mutual exclusion**: Resources can’t be shared.
2. **Hold and wait**: Holding one resource while waiting for another.
3. **No preemption**: Resources can't be forcibly taken.
4. **Circular wait**: A loop of threads each waiting for the next.

#### 🚫 Example:

```java
Thread-1:
    synchronized(lock1) {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        synchronized(lock2) { ... }
    }

Thread-2:
    synchronized(lock2) {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        synchronized(lock1) { ... }
    }
```

Both threads will **wait on each other forever** — this is a classic deadlock.

---

### ✅ 2. **Deadlock Detection**

* Use tools like:

  * **jconsole**
  * **VisualVM**
  * `jstack <pid>` (from command line)
* Look for "Found one Java-level deadlock" in thread dump.

---

### ✅ 3. **Deadlock Prevention Strategies**

* **Lock ordering**: Always acquire locks in a predefined order.
* **Timeouts**: Use `tryLock()` from `ReentrantLock` with timeout.
* **Avoid nested locks**: Reduce lock depth when possible.
* **Deadlock detection and recovery**: Rare but used in DBs.

---

### ✅ 4. **Livelocks**

#### 🔍 What is a Livelock?

A **livelock** happens when threads are **not blocked**, but continuously **change state to avoid collision**, and no thread progresses.

#### 🎭 Example (two threads politely backing off forever):

```java
// Both threads repeatedly give way to each other
```

#### ⚠️ How to Fix:

* Introduce **random backoff or delay**
* Add **retry limits**

---

### ✅ 5. **Starvation**

#### 🔍 What is Starvation?

Starvation occurs when a thread **waits indefinitely** to gain access to a resource because other high-priority threads keep preempting it.

#### ☠️ Causes:

* **Unfair locks**
* **Long-running tasks**
* **Thread priority abuse**

#### ✅ Fixes:

* Use **fair locks**: `new ReentrantLock(true)`
* Avoid long blocking tasks
* Use thread pools with **bounded queues**

---

### ✅ 6. **Fairness**

* **Fairness** ensures threads are served **in the order of request** (like a queue).
* Locks like `ReentrantLock(true)` enforce fairness but may reduce throughput.

#### ✅ Example:

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair
```

---

### ✅ 7. **Thread Dumps and Analysis**

#### 🔍 What is a Thread Dump?

A **snapshot** of all thread states (RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, etc.).

#### 📋 Tools:

* `jstack` (CLI)
* VisualVM, JConsole
* IntelliJ / Eclipse Profiler

#### 🔍 What to look for:

* Threads stuck in `BLOCKED` state → may signal deadlock
* Long `WAITING` → starvation or missed signal
* High CPU usage with low throughput → busy spinning

---

### ✅ 8. **Performance Tuning & Profiling**

#### 📌 Goals:

* Minimize thread contention
* Maximize CPU utilization
* Prevent idle or overloaded threads

#### 📋 Profiling Tools:

* **JFR (Java Flight Recorder)**
* **VisualVM**
* **JProfiler**
* **YourKit**
* **Async Profiler**

---

### ✅ Common Performance Issues

| Symptom                 | Possible Cause           | Solution                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| CPU 100% with low work  | Busy-wait, infinite loop | Use wait/notify or sleep        |
| Requests stall randomly | Deadlocks, GC            | Analyze thread dumps and memory |
| High memory usage       | Unbounded queues         | Use bounded thread pools        |
| Threads not progressing | Livelock                 | Add randomness or delays        |

---

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Concept         | Meaning                            | Fix                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Deadlock**    | Two threads hold and wait          | Lock ordering, `tryLock()` |
| **Livelock**    | Threads active but not progressing | Backoff strategy           |

## ✅ Real-World Tips

* Use `ExecutorService` instead of raw threads
* Prefer `Lock` over `synchronized` for fine-grained control
* Monitor thread states regularly in production
* In distributed systems, use **circuit breakers**, **rate limiters**, etc. to avoid overload

---

Would you like:

* A mini-project demonstrating deadlock and how to fix it?
* Or should we now move to **🧠 Real-World Use Cases and Interview Challenges**?

Absolutely! Here's a **deep dive into real-world multithreading use cases**, where **Java concurrency tools** shine in actual production-grade applications. These concepts not only help you become job-ready but also prepare you for **high-level system design and interviews**.

---

## 🧠 **15. Real-World Multithreading Use Cases – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ 1. **Web Server Thread Pools**

#### 🔍 Use Case:

Every time a user sends a request (HTTP), the server creates a thread to handle it. Creating a new thread for each request is **expensive**, so web servers use **thread pools**.

#### 🔧 Tools:

* `ExecutorService` → `FixedThreadPool`
* Servlets (Tomcat, Jetty) → internally use thread pools

#### ✅ Example:

```java
ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(50);

serverSocket.accept(); // simulate web request
threadPool.submit(() -> handleRequest(clientSocket));
```

#### 💡 Benefit:

* Reduces thread creation overhead
* Limits concurrency → avoids overloading CPU

---

### ✅ 2. **Background Job Processors**

#### 🔍 Use Case:

Jobs like sending emails, image processing, or report generation shouldn't block user interaction.

#### 🔧 Tools:

* `BlockingQueue` + `ThreadPoolExecutor`
* Message queues + job runners (e.g., Quartz, Spring Batch)

#### ✅ Pattern:

```java
BlockingQueue<Runnable> jobQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
ExecutorService jobExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

while (true) {
    Runnable job = jobQueue.take(); // blocks until job available
    jobExecutor.submit(job);
}
```

✅ Common in: **microservices**, **e-commerce**, **CMS** systems.

---

### ✅ 3. **Event-Driven Systems**

#### 🔍 Use Case:

Reactive systems respond to **events or messages** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, WebSocket).

#### 🔧 Tools:

* `CompletableFuture`, `ExecutorService`
* `ForkJoinPool`, **RxJava**, **Project Reactor**, **Akka**

#### ✅ Example:

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> fetchUserFromDB())
    .thenApply(user -> enrichWithProfile(user))
    .thenAccept(result -> sendEmail(result));
```

✅ Ideal for: **high-throughput**, **low-latency** systems.

---

### ✅ 4. **Asynchronous REST Calls**

#### 🔍 Use Case:

Web clients (or microservices) may call **multiple APIs concurrently** and return the combined result when all are complete.

#### 🔧 Tools:

* `CompletableFuture`, `ExecutorService`
* Spring WebFlux / AsyncRestTemplate

#### ✅ Example:

```java
CompletableFuture<User> userFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> getUser());
CompletableFuture<Order> orderFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> getOrders());

CompletableFuture<Void> all = CompletableFuture.allOf(userFuture, orderFuture);
all.thenRun(() -> {
    User u = userFuture.join();
    Order o = orderFuture.join();
    System.out.println("Combined result: " + u + ", " + o);
});
```

✅ Result: **Non-blocking**, faster APIs, **scalable REST clients**.

---

### ✅ 5. **Logging Frameworks**

#### 🔍 Use Case:

Logging should not block or slow down the main application logic.

#### 🔧 Tools:

* Asynchronous logger threads (like in **Log4j2 AsyncAppender**, **SLF4J**, **Logback**)
* Internally uses `BlockingQueue` + background thread

#### ✅ Pattern:

```java
// Async logger with queue
BlockingQueue<String> logQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

Runnable loggerWorker = () -> {
    while (true) {
        String log = logQueue.take(); // wait for log
        writeToDisk(log);
    }
};

new Thread(loggerWorker).start();
```

✅ Ensures logging is **fast, efficient, and non-blocking**.

---

### ✅ 6. **Android UI Threading (Handler, Looper)**

#### 🔍 Use Case:

Android restricts **UI updates to the main thread**, so long-running operations must be done on **background threads**.

#### 🔧 Tools:

* `Handler`, `Looper`, `HandlerThread`
* `AsyncTask` (deprecated), now `Executors`, `LiveData`, `Coroutine (Kotlin)`

#### ✅ Pattern:

```java
Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());

new Thread(() -> {
    String data = fetchDataFromInternet();
    handler.post(() -> updateUI(data)); // post to main thread
}).start();
```

✅ Keeps the app **responsive**, avoids **ANR (App Not Responding)**.

## 🔁 Summary Table

| Use Case            | Multithreading Tools            | Goal                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Web server requests | `ExecutorService`, thread pools | Efficiency, scalability     |
| Job queues          | `BlockingQueue`, `Executors`    | Async background processing |
| Event systems       | `CompletableFuture`, RxJava     | Reactive, async pipelines   |
| REST calls          | `CompletableFuture`, `allOf()`  | Parallel network calls      |
| Logging             | Logger thread, `BlockingQueue`  | Non-blocking logs           |
| Android UI          | `Handler`, `Looper`, `post()`   | UI thread safety            |

---

## ✅ Real-World Best Practices

* 🔒 Always use thread-safe collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `BlockingQueue`)
* ⚠️ Never block the UI or HTTP thread — use **Executors**, **Futures**
* ⛔ Avoid creating new threads manually; prefer **pooled executors**
* ✅ Profile thread usage in production using **JFR**, **VisualVM**, or **Android Profiler**

---

Would you like a **mini project** that shows these concepts together?
(e.g., Web job system that logs and handles async REST + thread pool?)

Or shall we move on to the final section:

Absolutely! Let’s deep dive into these **real-world interview-level coding challenges and enhancements** that test and demonstrate deep understanding of **Java multithreading**.

---

## 🧠 **16. Interview Questions & Coding Challenges – Deep Dive**

---

### ✅ 1. **Deadlock Detection Code**

#### 🎯 Goal:

Write code that leads to deadlock, and then analyze using `jstack`.

#### 🧱 Sample Deadlock Code:

```java
class DeadlockDemo {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock1...");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (Exception e) {}
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock2...");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock2...");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (Exception e) {}
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock1...");
                }
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### 🧠 Analysis:

* Use `jstack <pid>` and look for:

  ```
  Found one Java-level deadlock:
  ```

✅ **Prevention**: Use `ReentrantLock.tryLock()`, proper **lock ordering**.

---

### ✅ 2. **Producer-Consumer Implementation (Using BlockingQueue)**

#### 🎯 Goal:

Efficient thread communication between producers and consumers.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

        Runnable producer = () -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    queue.put(i);
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
        };

        Runnable consumer = () -> {
            try {
                while (true) {
                    Integer value = queue.take();
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
                    Thread.sleep(150);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
        };

        new Thread(producer).start();
        new Thread(consumer).start();
    }
}
```

✅ **Benefit**: Avoids `wait()/notify()` complexity using **blocking semantics**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Custom Thread Pool Executor**

#### 🎯 Goal:

Control how threads are created, rejected, and monitored.

```java
ExecutorService pool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    2, // core
    4, // max
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, // keep-alive
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), // task queue
    Executors.defaultThreadFactory(),
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy() // rejection handler
);
```

🧠 Customize with:

* `RejectedExecutionHandler`
* `ThreadFactory` for naming
* `beforeExecute`, `afterExecute` for monitoring

---

### ✅ 4. **Rate Limiter Using Semaphore**

#### 🎯 Goal:

Limit how many threads can access a resource per second.

```java
Semaphore rateLimiter = new Semaphore(3); // max 3 concurrent threads

Runnable task = () -> {
    try {
        if (rateLimiter.tryAcquire(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " allowed");
            Thread.sleep(500);
            rateLimiter.release();
        } else {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " rejected");
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
};

ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) pool.submit(task);
```

✅ Useful for: **API throttling**, **access control**, **concurrency limits**

---

### ✅ 5. **Ordered Execution of Threads**

#### 🎯 Goal:

Make 3 threads print in order: A → B → C repeatedly.

```java
class OrderedExecution {
    private static int turn = 0;
    private static final Object lock = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable printA = () -> print("A", 0);
        Runnable printB = () -> print("B", 1);
        Runnable printC = () -> print("C", 2);

        new Thread(printA).start();
        new Thread(printB).start();
        new Thread(printC).start();
    }

    static void print(String name, int expectedTurn) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (turn % 3 != expectedTurn) {
                    try { lock.wait(); } catch (Exception e) {}
                }
                System.out.println(name);
                turn++;
                lock.notifyAll();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

✅ Tests: **synchronization**, **wait/notify**, **shared state**

---

## 📌 Java 8+ Multithreading Enhancements

---

### ✅ `CompletableFuture` – Functional Async

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> getData())
                 .thenApply(data -> process(data))
                 .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println(result));
```

* `allOf()`, `anyOf()` for combining
* Handles async pipelines elegantly

---

### ✅ `parallelStream()` – Parallelism with Streams

```java
List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
nums.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
```

⚠️ Avoid when:

* There's shared mutable state
* Order matters

---

### ✅ `SubmissionPublisher` (Reactive Streams)

A basic reactive pub-sub framework:

```java
SubmissionPublisher<String> publisher = new SubmissionPublisher<>();
publisher.subscribe(data -> System.out.println("Got: " + data));
publisher.submit("Hello");
```

Used in **event-based**, **non-blocking** systems.

---

### ✅ Virtual Threads (Java 21+)

🔥 A game-changer for concurrency! Lightweight threads with **low memory overhead**.

```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running on virtual thread");
});
```

Benefits:

* Millions of threads possible
* Great for I/O-heavy workloads
* No need for custom thread pools

---
