# Java Multithreading Deep Dive

## 🟢 1. Introduction to Multithreading

---

### ✅ What is a Thread?

A **thread** is a lightweight, independent path of execution within a process.

In Java, every program runs at least one thread: the **main thread**.

#### 🔧 Analogy

> Think of a *process* as a restaurant, and each *thread* as a waiter — multiple waiters can serve different tables (tasks) simultaneously in the same restaurant (process).

### ✅ Process vs Thread

| Feature       | Process                                 | Thread                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Definition    | Independent unit of execution           | Sub-unit of a process              |
| Memory        | Has its own memory space (heap, stack)  | Shares memory with other threads   |
| Overhead      | Heavy (OS context switch)               | Light                              |
| Communication | Difficult (Inter-Process Communication) | Easy (shared memory)               |
| Crash Impact  | One process crash doesn't affect others | One thread crash may affect others |

---

### ✅ Advantages of Multithreading

1. **Improved performance** (parallelism)
    - Utilize multi-core CPUs efficiently.
2. **Responsiveness**
    - UI remains smooth while background tasks run.
3. **Better resource utilization**
    - CPU can execute other threads while one waits (I/O, DB).
4. **Simplified modeling**
    - Real-world concurrency like chat apps, servers, games.
5. **Scalability**
    - Ideal for web servers and microservices with thread pools.

### ✅ When and Why to Use Threads

| Use Case                            | Why Threads?                            |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| File downloads, uploads             | Prevent UI freeze, run in background    |
| Web or database servers             | Handle many users/requests concurrently |
| Real-time applications (games, IoT) | Need continuous updates/rendering       |
| Data processing                     | Parallel stream/data crunching          |
| Scheduled tasks                     | Repetitive execution (cron jobs)        |

---

### ✅ Life Cycle of a Thread

A Java thread goes through several **well-defined states** during its lifetime.

#### 🧬 Life Cycle Diagram

```
        NEW
         |
         v (start())
    RUNNABLE
     /   \
    /     \
BLOCKED  WAITING
    \     /
     v   v
TERMINATED
```

### ✅ Thread States in Java (`java.lang.Thread.State`)

| State           | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEW`           | Thread is created but not yet started                                                             |
| `RUNNABLE`      | Thread is eligible to run (may or may not be running, depending on the scheduler)                 |
| `BLOCKED`       | Thread is waiting to acquire a lock (e.g., `synchronized`)                                        |
| `WAITING`       | Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to signal (`wait()` / `join()` without timeout) |
| `TIMED_WAITING` | Thread is waiting for a specified time (`sleep()`, `join(1000)`, `wait(5000)`)                    |
| `TERMINATED`    | Thread has completed or terminated due to an exception                                            |

---

### ✅ Example: Thread Lifecycle in Code

```java
public class ThreadDemo {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
                System.out.println("Thread is running...");
          });

          System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW

          t.start();
          System.out.println(t.getState()); // RUNNABLE or TERMINATED (depends on timing)
     }
}
```

### 🧠 Key Concepts to Remember

| Concept                    | Meaning                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Thread is lightweight      | Shares process memory; creation cost is low       |
| Multithreading ≠ multicore | JVM switches threads rapidly on even one CPU      |
| Not all tasks benefit      | CPU-bound tasks may need careful thread design    |
| Threads need management    | Too many threads can slow the system (use pools!) |

---

## 🟢 2. Creating Threads in Java

Java provides multiple ways to create and run threads, mainly via the **`Thread`** class or the **`Runnable`** interface.

You can create threads by:

1. Extending `Thread` and overriding `run()`
2. Implementing `Runnable` and passing it to `Thread`
3. Using a lambda or anonymous class as a `Runnable`

```java
Thread thread4 = new Thread(() -> {
     System.out.println("Thread4 running");
});

Thread thread5 = new Thread() {
     public void run() {
          System.out.println("Thread5 running");
     }
};
```

---

### ✅ 1. Extending the `Thread` Class

You can create a new thread by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.

#### 🔧 Syntax

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
     @Override
     public void run() {
          System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
     }
}
```

#### ✅ Usage

```java
public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          MyThread t1 = new MyThread();  // Thread is in NEW state
          t1.start(); // Starts a new thread, executes run() in a new call stack
     }
}
```

---

### ⚠️ `start()` vs `run()` ⚠️

| Method    | Behavior                                                                |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start()` | Starts a **new thread** and invokes `run()` in that thread              |
| `run()`   | Just a normal method call; runs on the **current thread** (main thread) |

```java
t1.run();   // ❌ Not multithreaded (runs in main thread)
t1.start(); // ✅ New thread is spawned
```

---

### ✅ 2. Implementing the `Runnable` Interface

This is a **better and more flexible approach** — especially when:

- You want to **extend another class**
- You want to **reuse the same logic** across different threads

#### 🔧 Syntax

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
     @Override
     public void run() {
          System.out.println("Running thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
     }
}
```

#### ✅ Usage

```java
public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          Runnable task = new MyRunnable();
          Thread thread = new Thread(task);
          thread.start();
     }
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. Using Lambda Expression (Java 8+)

If you're using Java 8+, and your `Runnable` is simple, you can use a lambda.

```java
public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                System.out.println("Running with lambda on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
          });

          t1.start();
     }
}
```

This is **compact, clean, and modern**.

### ✅ When to Use Which?

| Approach          | When to Use                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Thread` subclass | Rarely; if you're customizing `Thread` class or learning basics |
| `Runnable`        | Preferred; for separation of task and thread                    |
| Lambda            | Best for simple, inline tasks (Java 8+)                         |

---

### ✅ Thread Naming and Priority (optional)

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Worker-1");
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // Optional
t.start();
```

---

### 🧠 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                              | Why it's wrong                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Calling `run()` instead of `start()` | Doesn't start a new thread        |
| Reusing a thread instance            | A thread can be started only once |
| Not handling exceptions in `run()`   | May crash silently                |

---

### ✅ Example: Multiple Threads Using Runnable

```java
class PrintTask implements Runnable {
     private String name;

     public PrintTask(String name) {
          this.name = name;
     }

     public void run() {
          System.out.println(name + " started by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
     }
}

public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          Thread t1 = new Thread(new PrintTask("Task 1"));
          Thread t2 = new Thread(new PrintTask("Task 2"));

          t1.start();
          t2.start();
     }
}
```
