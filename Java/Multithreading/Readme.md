# 🍔 Online Food Delivery System (Multithreaded Java Project)

This Java mini-project simulates a multithreaded online food delivery system, designed to demonstrate **core to advanced Java multithreading concepts**.

---

## 🧵 Features & Concepts Covered

✅ Thread creation via `Thread`, `Runnable`, and `ExecutorService`  
✅ Thread lifecycle: `start()`, `run()`, `join()`, `interrupt()`  
✅ Thread control: `sleep()`, `yield()`, `setPriority()`  
✅ Thread-safe communication using `BlockingQueue`  
✅ Shared data management with `AtomicInteger`  
✅ Safe logging with `ReentrantLock`  
✅ Graceful shutdown with `shutdown()` and `awaitTermination()`  
✅ Simulated Producer-Consumer with multiple delivery agents  
✅ Demonstrates use of both low-level and high-level concurrency APIs  

---

## 🧠 Project Architecture

- **OrderProducer**: Generates new orders (food items) and adds to a blocking queue.
- **DeliveryAgent**: Multiple threads consume (deliver) orders from the queue.
- **Main Thread**: Orchestrates the system, waits for some time, then shuts it down.
- **Thread-Safe Logger**: Ensures consistent output even with concurrent access.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac FoodDeliverySystem.java
````

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java FoodDeliverySystem
   ```

---

## 📦 Sample Output

```
[NEW ORDER] OrderID: 1, Item: Burger
DeliveryAgent-1 delivered OrderID: 1
DeliveryAgent-2 found no orders. Yielding...
[NEW ORDER] OrderID: 2, Item: Biryani
...
========= DELIVERY LOG =========
[NEW ORDER] OrderID: 1, Item: Burger
DeliveryAgent-1 delivered OrderID: 1
...
================================
```

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

* Understand thread lifecycle and task coordination
* Learn how to avoid race conditions
* Learn producer-consumer patterns using `BlockingQueue`
* Learn to build scalable systems using thread pools

---

## 📚 Suggested Extensions

* Add GUI for order placement and delivery tracking
* Persist logs to a file using `FileWriter`
* Use `ScheduledExecutorService` for periodic order simulation
* Track statistics (e.g., delivery time, agent utilization)
