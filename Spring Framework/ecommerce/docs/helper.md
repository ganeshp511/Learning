Using the **Builder Pattern** instead of just creating an object directly with the `new` keyword has several advantages ‚Äî especially when object construction is complex.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

---

### **1. Handles complex object creation**

* **`new` keyword:** You pass all constructor arguments at once, often leading to huge constructors (telescoping constructors problem).
* **Builder:** Lets you set parameters step-by-step before creating the object.

  ```java
  // Without Builder
  new User("John", "Doe", 25, "john@example.com", true);

  // With Builder
  new User.Builder()
      .firstName("John")
      .lastName("Doe")
      .age(25)
      .email("john@example.com")
      .isActive(true)
      .build();
  ```

---

### **2. Improves code readability**

* Instead of remembering the **order** of parameters in a constructor, the Builder makes it explicit what each value represents.
* Much less risk of accidentally swapping values (e.g., passing `"Doe"` where age is expected).

---

### **3. Optional parameters without overloading**

* With `new`, optional parameters require **constructor overloading** or `null` placeholders.
* Builder allows you to set only the fields you care about, skipping the rest.

---

### **4. Immutability**

* A Builder typically constructs **immutable** objects (all fields `final`), improving thread safety.
* Direct `new` calls often involve mutable objects unless you take extra care.

---

### **5. Better maintenance**

* Adding a new field to the object doesn‚Äôt require changing all constructors; you just add a new method in the Builder.
* Reduces constructor explosion in large models.

---

### **6. Validation before object creation**

* Builder can run **validation logic** before `build()` returns the object.
* With `new`, validation is often done in the constructor, which can become messy if conditions are complex.

---

### **7. Supports complex assembly logic**

* Builder can encapsulate multi-step creation logic (like setting defaults, computing derived fields, or creating related objects).
* With `new`, you‚Äôd have to do all that logic outside and then pass everything into the constructor.
