# Technical Concepts Used in This Project

This Spring Boot ecommerce project leverages a wide range of technical concepts and patterns. Below is a comprehensive summary with explanations and code examples.

---

## 1. Spring Boot Framework
Spring Boot simplifies Java application development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @SpringBootApplication
  public class EcommerceApplication {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          SpringApplication.run(EcommerceApplication.class, args);
      }
  }
  ```

---

## 2. RESTful API Design
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Controllers expose endpoints mapped to HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) and paths.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api/admin")
  public class AdminController {
      @PostMapping("/company")
      public ResponseEntity<?> createCompany(@RequestBody CreateCompanyRequestDto dto) {
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Stateless communication
  - Clear separation of resources
  - Easy integration with front-end clients

---

## 3. Dependency Injection (DI)
DI allows Spring to manage object creation and wiring, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @Autowired
  private AdminService adminService;
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces boilerplate
  - Improves testability (mocking dependencies)

---

## 4. Layered Architecture
The codebase is organized into layers, each with a specific responsibility:
- **Controller Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer:** Contains business logic and transaction management.
- **Repository Layer:** Data access logic (CRUD operations).
- **Entity Layer:** Domain models mapped to database tables.
- **DTO Layer:** Data Transfer Objects for API communication.

---

## 5. JPA & ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
JPA annotations map Java objects to relational database tables, enabling seamless data persistence.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @Entity
  @Table(name = "products")
  public class Product { ... }
  ```
- **Relationships:**
  - `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, etc. define how entities relate.

---

## 6. DTO (Data Transfer Object) Pattern
DTOs are used to transfer data between client and server, decoupling API models from database models.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  public class ProductDTO {
      private String name;
      private Double price;
      // ...
  }
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Security (expose only necessary fields)
  - Flexibility in API evolution

---

## 7. Repository Pattern
Repositories abstract data access, using interfaces that extend `JpaRepository` for CRUD operations.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @Repository
  public interface ProductRepo extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> { }
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces boilerplate
  - Built-in query methods

---

## 8. Transaction Management
Ensures data consistency and integrity during database operations.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @Transactional
  public class AdminService { ... }
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Automatic rollback on failure
  - Consistent state

---

## 9. Enum Usage
Enums define a fixed set of constants for domain concepts (e.g., order statuses, user roles).
- **Example:**
  ```java
  public enum OrderStatus { SHIPPED, DELIVERED, DRAFT, PLACED, ACCEPTED }
  ```

---

## 10. Logging
Logging provides runtime information for debugging and monitoring.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AdminController.class);
  LOGGER.info("Creating company");
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Easier troubleshooting
  - Operational insights

---

## 11. Exception Handling
Handles errors gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  if(company == null){
      throw new HttpClientErrorException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST,"Company Does not exist");
  }
  ```

---

## 12. Lombok
Lombok generates boilerplate code (getters, setters, etc.) at compile time, reducing clutter.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @Data
  public class Product {
      private String name;
      private Double price;
      // ...
  }
  ```

---

## 13. Entity Relationships
Defines how entities relate to each other in the database.
- **Example:**
  - `@ManyToOne` between `Product` and `Company`
  - `@ManyToOne` between `Order` and `User`

---

## 14. Bean Management
Spring manages the lifecycle of beans (components, services, repositories) for you.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  @Service
  public class SellerService { ... }
  ```

---

## 15. API Documentation (Javadoc)
Javadoc comments are used throughout the code to describe classes, methods, and parameters, aiding maintainability.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  /**
   * Endpoint to create a new product.
   * @param productDTO Product data from the request body
   * @return ResponseEntity with creation result
   */
  ```

---

## 16. Persistence Layer Abstraction
By using JPA repositories, the project abstracts away direct SQL queries, relying on Spring Data to generate them.
- **Benefits:**
  - Cleaner code
  - Easy switching of underlying database

---

## 17. Validation (Potential/Recommended)
Although not shown in the code snippets, Spring supports validation with annotations like `@Valid`, `@NotNull`, etc. This is recommended for production projects.

---

## 18. Modularization and Separation of Concerns
Each class has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

---

## 19. Use of Java 8+ Features
The codebase uses features like `LocalDateTime` for date/time management and Java enums for type safety.
