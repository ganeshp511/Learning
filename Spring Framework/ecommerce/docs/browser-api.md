### **1. Browser as an API Client**

* The browser sends requests to your backend API (Spring Boot, JAX-RS, etc.) just like Postman would.
* The main difference: browsers follow **same-origin policy** and **CORS rules**, so some requests may be blocked unless your backend allows them.

---

### **2. Use DevTools (F12)**

* **Network tab** → See every API request, its method (GET/POST), URL, headers, request body, response status, and data.
* **Console tab** → Run quick tests with `fetch()` or see JavaScript errors that might explain failed calls.
* **Application tab** → Check cookies, localStorage, or tokens sent/received from your backend.

---

### **3. Common Checks**

* Make sure request URL matches your controller mapping in Java (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`).
* Verify JSON payload matches your DTO fields.
* Check HTTP status codes:

    * `200` → OK
    * `400` → Bad request (frontend sent wrong data)
    * `500` → Server error (check backend logs)

---

### **4. Typical Issues**

* **CORS error:** Fix by adding `@CrossOrigin` or CORS config in Spring Boot.
* **Wrong payload:** Update Java DTO or frontend request format.
* **Auth problems:** Ensure JWT tokens or session cookies are sent correctly.

---

### **5. Handy Browser Tools**

* Swagger UI → Interactive docs and testing.
* GraphQL Playground → For GraphQL APIs.
* JSON viewer extensions → Easier reading of API responses.

If you want, I can now make you a **simple step-by-step checklist** that every Java backend dev can follow when debugging APIs in the browser.
That way you’d never get lost in the process.
