Perfect topic 🌐 — let’s dive into **API Gateway** in the context of REST APIs with Spring Boot.

# 🔹 API Gateway in REST APIs

---

## 1. What is an API Gateway?

Imagine you have many microservices:

* **User Service** → manages users
* **Order Service** → manages orders
* **Payment Service** → handles payments

If a frontend or mobile app had to call each service directly, problems arise:

* Too many different endpoints (`/users/...`, `/orders/...`, `/payments/...`)
* Security (each service needs authentication/authorization)
* Logging, monitoring, rate-limiting become inconsistent

👉 An **API Gateway** is a **single entry point** for clients.
It forwards (or proxies) requests to appropriate backend services.

### Think of it like:

* Airport security gate ✈️ → one entry, multiple destinations.

---

## 2. Why Use an API Gateway?

✅ **Single entry point** → `/api/...` instead of many service URLs
✅ **Security** → authentication & authorization centralized
✅ **Rate limiting** → protect services from abuse
✅ **Load balancing** → distribute requests across service instances
✅ **Request/response transformation** → modify headers, formats
✅ **Monitoring/logging** → track requests in one place

---

## 3. API Gateway in Spring Ecosystem

The most popular option: **Spring Cloud Gateway**.

### Features of Spring Cloud Gateway:

* Built on **Spring WebFlux** (reactive, non-blocking).
* Easy to configure **routes** (map incoming request → backend service).
* Supports filters (pre/post request handling).
* Works well with **Spring Security**.

---

## 4. Example: Spring Cloud Gateway Setup

### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

### application.yml Configuration

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: user-service
          uri: http://localhost:8081
          predicates:
            - Path=/users/**
        - id: order-service
          uri: http://localhost:8082
          predicates:
            - Path=/orders/**
```

👉 Now:

* `http://localhost:8080/users/1` → forwarded to User Service
* `http://localhost:8080/orders/123` → forwarded to Order Service

Clients only know **gateway URL**.

---

## 5. Filters in Gateway

Filters = interceptors that run **before or after** request handling.

### Example: Add Header

```yaml
filters:
  - AddRequestHeader=X-Request-Source, API-Gateway
```

### Example: Strip Path

```yaml
filters:
  - StripPrefix=1
```

So `/api/users/1` becomes `/users/1` before forwarding.

---

## 6. Security with Gateway

* Integrate with **Spring Security** at gateway level.
* Validate **JWT tokens** in gateway → forward only if valid.
* Services don’t need to repeat auth logic.

---

## 7. Alternatives to Spring Cloud Gateway

* **Kong API Gateway** → popular open-source, plugins for auth/rate limiting.
* **NGINX** or **HAProxy** → lightweight reverse proxies.
* **AWS API Gateway** → managed service on cloud.

---

# ✅ Summary

* **API Gateway** = single entry point for microservices.
* Handles routing, security, rate limiting, logging.
* In Spring, use **Spring Cloud Gateway**.
* Configure routes in `application.yml`.
* Use filters for request/response customization.
* Can centralize authentication (JWT, OAuth2).

👉 Do you want me to go deeper into:

1. **Implementing JWT authentication at API Gateway** (so microservices stay simpler),
   OR
2. **Performance features of Gateway** (rate limiting, load balancing, circuit breakers with Resilience4j)?
