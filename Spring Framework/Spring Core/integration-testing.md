Perfect 👌 — let’s unpack that definition carefully, because **“integration test”** is a slippery term.

When people say *integration test* in Spring Boot (or Java in general), they usually mean **one of three increasing scopes**, just like you wrote. I’ll explain each in depth, with examples.

---

# 🔹 1. Test that covers multiple *units*

* **Unit test** → tests one class in isolation (e.g., `ProductService` by mocking `ProductRepository`).
* **Integration test at this level** → tests a cluster of related classes working together, no mocks.

👉 Example:

```java
@SpringBootTest
class ProductServiceIT {

  @Autowired ProductService productService;  // depends on repo + mapper
  @Autowired ProductRepository productRepository;

  @Test
  void getProduct_returnsEntityFromRepo() {
    productRepository.save(new Product(null, "Laptop"));

    ProductDto dto = productService.getProduct("Laptop");

    assertEquals("Laptop", dto.getName());
  }
}
```

✅ Here, `ProductService` + `ProductRepository` + JPA + DB all run together.
It’s beyond a “unit test”, but not yet end-to-end.

---

# 🔹 2. Test that covers multiple *layers*

Now we cross architectural boundaries: controller → service → repository.
We’re not just checking class collaboration, but **layer integration**.

👉 Example:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class ProductApiIT {

  @Autowired MockMvc mvc;
  @Autowired ProductRepository repo;

  @BeforeEach
  void setup() {
    repo.deleteAll();
    repo.save(new Product(null, "Phone"));
  }

  @Test
  void request_gets_through_controller_service_and_repo() throws Exception {
    mvc.perform(get("/api/products"))
       .andExpect(status().isOk())
       .andExpect(jsonPath("$[0].name").value("Phone"));
  }
}
```

✅ This test ensures:

* Spring MVC mapping works
* Controller calls service
* Service queries repo
* JPA returns data

We’re covering **multiple layers of the app**.

---

# 🔹 3. Test that covers the *whole path* through the application

This is the **broadest scope**: a request enters the real HTTP server, traverses all layers, touches the DB, and returns a response. Sometimes it even calls external services (stubbed with WireMock or Testcontainers).

👉 Example:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class ProductEndToEndIT {

  @LocalServerPort int port;
  @Autowired TestRestTemplate rest;
  @Autowired ProductRepository repo;

  @BeforeEach
  void seed() {
    repo.deleteAll();
    repo.save(new Product(null, "Headphones"));
  }

  @Test
  void full_request_path_changes_database_state() {
    String baseUrl = "http://localhost:" + port;

    // send POST to create product
    rest.postForEntity(baseUrl + "/api/products", new ProductDto("Tablet"), Void.class);

    // verify DB has changed
    assertThat(repo.findByName("Tablet")).isPresent();

    // send GET to retrieve it
    var response = rest.getForEntity(baseUrl + "/api/products", ProductDto[].class);
    assertThat(response.getBody()).extracting("name").contains("Tablet");
  }
}
```

✅ This is the **closest to real production flow**:

* Runs inside an embedded server
* Real HTTP request/response cycle
* Hits DB for persistence
* Verifies both **response correctness** and **side effects on database state**

---

# 🔹 Putting it together

So an *integration test* could mean:

1. **Multiple units together** (service + repo + DB)

   * scope: a few classes
   * speed: relatively fast
   * catches: wiring/config issues

2. **Multiple layers together** (controller → service → repo)

   * scope: entire app layers
   * speed: slower than unit, but faster than full HTTP
   * catches: REST mapping, validation, JSON

3. **Whole path (end-to-end)** (HTTP → controller → service → repo → DB → response)

   * scope: complete app path
   * speed: slowest
   * catches: everything including serialization, networking, DB state

---

✅ **Summary**:

* The “integration” in integration tests means *integration of components*.
* Scope can vary: from a couple of classes working together, to multiple layers, to the whole request flow.
* The broader the scope, the more confidence — but also the slower the tests.
* In real Spring Boot projects, teams use **all three levels**, carefully balanced.
